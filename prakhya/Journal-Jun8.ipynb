    "I've mentioned the word easing a few times in this article, and maybe you're wondering what that means. Easing's are mathematical functions that determine the speed of the animation at different stages throughout its duration. For example, an \"ease-in-out\" easing gradually accelerates at the beginning of the animation, and gradually decelerates near the end of the animation. A \"linear\" easing has a constant speed throughout the duration, and looks very jarring and robotic.\n",
