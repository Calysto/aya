    "The any type is a powerful way to work with existing JavaScript, allowing you to opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation. You might expect Object to play a similar role, as it does in other languages. But variables of type Object only allow you to assign any value to them – you can’t call arbitrary methods on them, even ones that actually exist:\n",

    "void is a little like the opposite of any: the absence of having any type at all. You may commonly see this as the return type of functions that do not return a value\n",

    "Type assertions are a way to tell the compiler “trust me, I know what I’m doing.” A type assertion is like a type cast in other languages, but performs no special checking or restructuring of data. It has no runtime impact, and is used purely by the compiler. TypeScript assumes that you, the programmer, have performed any special checks that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type assertions have two forms. One is the “angle-bracket” syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "let someValue: any = \"this is a string\";\n",

    "let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;\n",

    "\n",
    "let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;\n",
    "\n",
    "You may’ve noticed that so far, we’ve been using the let keyword instead of JavaScript’s var keyword which you might be more familiar with. The let keyword is actually a newer JavaScript construct that TypeScript makes available. We’ll discuss the details later, but many common problems in JavaScript are alleviated by using let, so you should use it instead of var whenever possible.\n",
